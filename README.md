# LIBFT project 📚
The **LIBFT project** at 42 involves creating a custom C library that replicates many functions from the standard C library (such as atoi, calloc, strjoin...). 🛠️

Implementing these commonly used functions help us develop our knowledge about string manipulation, memory allocation and linked list operations.

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of low-level programmig, memory management and algorithm implementation. 

## Features 📋
- **String manipulation:** functions to handle strings
- **Memory allocation:** custom memory management functions
- **Linked list operations:** basic linked list functionalities

## Objectives 🎯
1. Understand low-level programming
2. Improve memory management skills
3. Implement efficient algorithms

## Installation 🛠️
To install the library :

git clone git@github.com:elodieiam/libft.git
